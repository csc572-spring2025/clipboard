# ClipBoard (Maybe a little more descriptive?)

One-liner? Maybe move the brief description up here
Developed by CSC572: The Open Source Movement, Spring 2024-2025

## Brief Description (update this to be more complex as stuff gets developed)
ClipBoard records everything copied to the system clipboard and aims to intelligently organize it into categories like code snippets, quotes, math equations, URLs, or plain text. Users can search past entries via tags, date, or keywords, making it easy to find what they copied days or weeks ago.
