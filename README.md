## Brief Description
ClipBoard records everything copied to the system clipboard and aims to intelligently organize it into categories like code snippets, quotes, math equations, URLs, or plain text. Users can search past entries via tags, date, or keywords, making it easy to find what they copied days or weeks ago.
